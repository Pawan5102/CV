     I am a student at Punjab University through correspondence means. Its my 5th semester now. I am also working as a part-time stenographer in Chief Justice's Office. I started working as a stenographer right after completion of my secondary education because I was a student of stenography at that time. But now I dropped the course. Now learning coding. Hurrey! üòÉ Besides this I am a part time blogger too, I own <strong> <em> <a href="https://biographpoint.blogspot.com/">Biograph Point</em></a></strong>  website, a hindi blog. Hmmm...! so much on little shoulders üòÖ. I think now you guys got the idea why I am learning coding. There are time when I really struggled with html codes while managing my site.
